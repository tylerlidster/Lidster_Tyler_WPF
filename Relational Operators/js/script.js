//Relational Operators
//Comparing 2 variables or values

//Greater Than >
//Less Than <
//Greater than or equal to >=
//Less than or equal to <=

//They compare two values or variables (only 2!)

//The comparison results in TRUE or FALSE


//EQUALITY OPERATORS

//Equality is ==
//Strict Equality is ===
//Inequality is !=


//Never use a space between an operator!!!

//COMPARING VALUES
//5 < 5 is false
//5 <= 5 is true
//Statements that are logically the same
//a > b     b < a

//Equality == compares two values
//Assignment = stores values

// a==b means a is the same as b
//a=b - means - a stores the value of b

//STRICT EQUALITY uses the === operator
//"the same value and the same type"
//the same type means
// - 6 number
// - "6" string
// - 6 == "6"
// - 6 === "6" does not work/is false

//USE STRICT EQUALITY OVER EQUALITY
// === IS BETTER THAN ==

//Inequality uses the != operator
//which is NOT the same as a!=b
