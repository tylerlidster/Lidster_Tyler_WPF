//Assignment Operators
//An expression with assignment
//For creating arithmetic expressions

//equal sign operation

//var a = 3;
//a + 4; //does not store the + 4
//console.log(a);
//will display the number 3



//to change a we need to assign the expression to a
//var a = 3;
//a = a + 4; //storage container always goes on the left
//console.log(a);
//adds 3 = 4 and displays the number 7



//The =+ operator
//var a = 3;
//a += 4;
//console.log(a);

//same as above
// just uses an assignment operator that combines those two functions


//to multiply use *=

// same as above but it would be a *= 4;
//which would multiply 4 * 3 and display the result

//to divide use /=

// a /= 4;
//divides 3 / 4 and displays result

//to subtract use -= operator


//increment operators
//only works with the number 1

var a = 3;
a ++ ; //is the same as a = a + 1 //a =+ 1
console.log(a);
//which gives you 3 + 1 and displays as 4


//decrement operator does the same just subtracts 1
a--; //no space //the same as //a = a - 1 // a -+1
//which gives you 3 - 1 and displays as 2
