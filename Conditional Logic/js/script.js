//Conditional Logic

var oldEnough = true;

//if the child is old enough print to the console "You can ride"

//basic structure of a conditional statement
//the condition goes inside the parentheses
//the code block goes inside the curly braces - if true

if(oldEnough){
    console.log("You Can Ride The Coaster");
}
